# Mock_Hospital_SQL_DB
Mock Hospital SQL DB is a database that was created as project to be submitted for my undergraduate Database Management class at California State University, San Bernardino. The goal of the database is to implement a framework for an application that unifies all existing records about a patient as well as provides scheduling and communication services with any assigned doctor. It also acts as an activity tracker and a social networking page, where you can communicate with other patients and support groups. This backend database should allow for several functions that revolve around the status of the patients. For example, a doctor should be able to quickly pull up a patientâ€™s contact information and medical history. Things such as vaccinations, and blood type will be readily available to certified employees. Some other basic functions include:
1. Access to a profile with all existing health records of a patient. 
2. Ability to schedule / cancel appointments.
3. Ability to contact an assigned medical professional.
4. Keeping certain information anonymous.
5. Ability to track and update exercise and calorie intake.
a. Can be private or public.
6. Ability to chat with patients who have similar symptoms.

The database was created using Oracle SQL.
